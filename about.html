                                <p class="mb-0"> Allow me to introduce myself.  </p>

                                <p class="mb-0"> My name is Martino Dario, and in middle school I was fascinated by the world of technology and computers. My first thought was to learn about that part of the world that I did not know. </p>

                                <p class="mb-0"> This knowledge I was able to bring to this school, thanks in part to the middle school teachers who recommended this school for the preparation I had and for what I could aspire to. </p>

                                <p class="mb-0">  I learned many important concepts at this school, but the ones that stuck with me were communication and teamwork, because we had to figure out how to interact with classmates to complete the assigned task. </p>

                                <p class="mb-0">  Another aspect was knowing how to manage the time available to complete all the tasks in the allotted time especially because I had to alternate with my passions in the time available and specifically I had to alternate with handball.
                                    Handball is a competitive sport that I have been playing for more than 10 years and I have always enjoyed playing it. </p>

                                <p class="mb-0"> Right now I do not have an aspiration but a goal to achieve in the next few years, this goal is to go to the University of Genoa and learn statistics at DIMA.
                                    Especially after being at their orientation, I realized how interested I am in going to college. </p>
